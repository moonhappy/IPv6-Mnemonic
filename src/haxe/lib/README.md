Help make IPv6 Addresses 🤖 more human-friendly 🕺🏻
</p>

**IPv6 Mnemonic** is an alternative way to represent [IPv6 Addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Representation) 
by representing the address as written prose (sentence, paragraph, poem).

# Synopsis

The representation of [IPv6 Addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Representation) 
is not exactly the most human-friendly way to remember them. Although the 
specification does help to compact and simplify the representation, hexadecimal 
is not often easily remembered or discussed between people (at least, in my 
experience).

# Install

_todo..._

# Testing

You have the option to run the project unit tests in the following ways:

- Directly from Visual Studio Code as a HXCPP build; or
- From CLI.

## Testing: Visual Studio Code

The project has the Visual Studio Code `.vscode` configuration pre-defined so that building and running the project in debug mode is enabled "out-of-the-box". Simply pressing `F5` will initiate a build and run the unit tests in debug mode, which will exercise the project source code and allow runtime inspection using break-points. However, some inital configuration is needed first (assuming Haxe has already been installed):

1. Install the [Haxe Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vshaxe.haxe-extension-pack) extension in VS Code.
2. Install hxcpp: `haxelib install hxcpp`.
3. Install utest: `haxelib install utest`.
4. Install cpp debug server: `haxelib install hxcpp-debug-server`.
5. Run "HXCPP: Setup" from VS Code command palette (`F1` or `CMD+SHIFT+P`).
6. Restart VS Code (just to be safe), then hit `F5` to initiate build and run debug of the unit tests.

After the initial steps are completed, you don't need do these steps again.

## Testing: CLI

Running unit tests via the CLI will not have the advantage of debugging support, but are a quick and easy solution to validate the project using the unit tests. Likewise, it allows continuous integration solutions a means to build and test the project.

To run full build and unit tests on the CLI, simply enter the following in Terminal:
```sh
haxe hxml/test-ci.hxml
```

# Generate Code Documents

HTML documentation of the code will be automatically generated using Travis CI build system (see the `.travis.yml` build config for details). So the following is only really needed for local drafting and review of the documentation output.

Standard code documentation can be generated by running the `hxml.gen-docs.hxml` build configuration. This will create the code document XML file and HTML files using [Dox](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox) (be sure to install Dox first before running the following hxml). 

Run the following on CLI to generate the Haxe XML doc file:
```sh
haxe hxml/gen-docs.hxml
```
